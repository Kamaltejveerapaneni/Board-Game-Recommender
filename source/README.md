Introduction
Its a simple Machine Learning project using Linear Regression 
to find the "average_rating" for a given board game.


## Data Set
1. 
Rows: 83000
2.
 Columns: 20 (features)
3. 
After analysing given 20 features, I choosed 2 features "average_weight" and "minage" because of their good correlation values.


## Programminig Language
Python is used here with libraries:
 
1. pandas: for reading/writing csv files, dealing with dataframe object

2. sklearn: for LinearRegression, cross validation, mean square error and correlations

3. matplotlib: for plotting graphs
